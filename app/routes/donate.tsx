                        Aure is a project born from my passion for creating useful tools for the community. Since day one, my goal has been to provide an accessible and fair solution for everyone, with no profit motive.

                        However, to keep Aure running, I need to cover server costs and external services, including some paid APIs. If Aure has been helpful to you and you'd like to support the project, any contribution would be deeply appreciated. Every donation helps maintain the infrastructure and ensures that this tool remains available to everyone.
